![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35ec3c0c-4fc0-415a-bb65-38b817f58edf)

ACET (Advanced Code Execution Tool) is a simple, browser-based utility for running HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets directly in the DOM of any web page. Created for quick testing and experimentation, ACET provides an interface at the top of the page where users can input and execute code. With additional functionality for fetching JSON data, ACET is especially useful for developers looking to test ideas in a controlled, in-browser environment.
> This branch is intended for testing unfinished code. Please use it at your own risk and be aware that the code may not function as expected or may contain bugs. We recommend using the main branch.
